## MultiShotCalibration2D
Camera calibration using multiple shots of checkerboard target covering different angles and various correction modes
### Description
Calibrating a camera using multiple shots of a checkerboard calibration target,
covering the field-of-view at different poses. Correcting the image by rectification
using different correction modes.
### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage.
To run this sample a device with SICK Algorithm API is necessary.
For example InspectorP or SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the
Emulator on AppStudio 2.2 or higher can be used. The images can be seen in the
image viewer on the DevicePage.
